        Yesterday we found a baby fawn sleeping<br>
        alone underneath a small playset in our<br>
        backyard. Does will intentionally "abandon"<br>
        their young for long periods of time so as not<br>
        to attract predators to their location. We<br>
        watched it rest for a while from the deck.<br>
        <br>
        Later that night the mother came back. The<br>
        fawn nursed for a while, and then they walked<br>
        through our backyard out to the street before<br>
        disappearing into somebody else's yard.<br>
        <br>
        This morning the sky was so clear, the sun so<br>
        bright that I didn't stop to ask if I deserved it.<br>
        Birds fed on a railing covered in seed, and I<br>
        watched them. Everything smiled.<br>
