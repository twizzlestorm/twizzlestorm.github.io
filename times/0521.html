        yesterday we found a baby fawn sleeping<br>
        alone underneath a small playset in our<br>
        backyard. does will intentionally "abandon"<br>
        their young for long periods of time so as not<br>
        to attract predators to their location. we<br>
        watched it rest for a while from the deck.<br>
        <br>
        later that night the mother came back. the<br>
        fawn nursed for a while, and then they walked<br>
        through our backyuard out to the street before<br>
        disappearing into somebody else's yard.<br>
        <br>
        this morning the sky was so clear, the sun so<br>
        bright that i didn't stop to ask if i deserved it.<br>
        birds fed on a railing covered in seed, and i<br>
        watched them. everything smiled.<br>
